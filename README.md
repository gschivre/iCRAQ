# iCRAQ
ImageJ macro developed to analyse chromocenters in plant nucleus

To run iCRAQ place *iCRAQ_main.txt* in a folder named "iCRAQ" inside macros folder of ImageJ.

This macros rely on **ActionBar** plugin which can be download here: https://figshare.com/articles/Custom_toolbars_and_mini_applications_with_Action_Bar/3397603/3

And also use **ImageScience** pluging and **SCF MPI CBG** plugin which can be added through their update site in ImageJ (https://sites.imagej.net/ImageScience/ and https://sites.imagej.net/SCF-MPI-CBG/ respectively).

This macro was developed during an internship in IBENS under the supervision of Fredy Barneche and Clara Bourbousse.
