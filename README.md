# iCRAQ
ImageJ macro developed to analyse chromocenters in plant nucleus

To run iCRAQ place *iCRAQ_main.txt* in a folder named "iCRAQ" inside macros folder of ImageJ.
The R function *read_iCRAQ.R* is designed to open multiple results files produced by iCRAQ and compute chromocenter number, RHF and RAF.

This macros rely on **ActionBar** plugin which can be download here: https://figshare.com/articles/Custom_toolbars_and_mini_applications_with_Action_Bar/3397603/3

And also use **ImageScience** pluging and **SCF MPI CBG** plugin which can be added through there update site in ImageJ (https://sites.imagej.net/ImageScience/ and https://sites.imagej.net/SCF-MPI-CBG/ respectively).
